# Releasing

## Prerequisites

Access to `vegemite.lightbend.com`

## Process

* Add the release to README.md, PR and merge to main
* Log in to `vegemite.lightbend.com`
* `cd deploy`
* `./release --project scalatestplus-play --branch main --tag 5.1.0` (notice: the tag is not prefixed with a 'v')

## Future

We'd like to improve this process so releasing is just a matter
of tagging the release in github, and having a service like Travis
actually do the release.

This should be fairly close since we're already using sbt-dynver
and sbt-release.

Help welcome!
