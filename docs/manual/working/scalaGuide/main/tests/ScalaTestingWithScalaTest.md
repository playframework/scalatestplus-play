# Testing your application with ScalaTest

Writing tests for your application can be an involved process. Play provides helpers and application stubs, and ScalaTest provides an integration library, _ScalaTest + Play_, to make testing your application as easy as possible.

## Overview

The location for tests is in the "test" folder. <!-- There are two sample test files created in the test folder which can be used as templates. -->

You can run tests from the Play console.

* To run all tests, run `test`.
* To run only one test class, run `test-only` followed by the name of the class, i.e., `test-only my.namespace.MySpec`.
* To run only the tests that have failed, run `test-quick`.
* To run tests continually, run a command with a tilde in front, i.e. `~test-quick`.
* To access test helpers such as `FakeRequest` in console, run `test:console`.

Testing in Play is based on SBT, and a full description is available in the [testing SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Testing.html) chapter.

## Using ScalaTest + Play

To use _ScalaTest + Play_, you'll need to add it to your build, by changing `build.sbt` like this:

```scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.scalatestplus.play" %% "scalatestplus-play" % "x.x.x" % "test"
)
```

Where `x.x.x` is a specific version os `scalatestplus-play` artifact, for example `3.0.0`. See the [available releases here](https://github.com/playframework/scalatestplus-play#releases).

You do not need to add ScalaTest to your build explicitly. The proper version of ScalaTest will be brought in automatically as a transitive dependency of _ScalaTest + Play_. You will, however, need to select a version of _ScalaTest + Play_ that matches your Play version. You can do so by checking the [releases compatibility](https://github.com/playframework/scalatestplus-play#releases) matrix for _ScalaTest + Play_.

In _ScalaTest + Play_, you define test classes by extending the [`PlaySpec`](api/scala/org/scalatestplus/play/PlaySpec.html) trait. Here's an example:

@[scalatest-stackspec](code/StackSpec.scala)

You can alternatively [define your own base classes](http://scalatest.org/user_guide/defining_base_classes) instead of using `PlaySpec`.

You can run your tests with Play itself, or in IntelliJ IDEA (using the [Scala plugin](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/SCA/Scala+Plugin+for+IntelliJ+IDEA)) or in Eclipse (using the [Scala IDE](http://scala-ide.org/) and the [ScalaTest Eclipse plugin](http://scalatest.org/user_guide/using_scalatest_with_eclipse)).  Please see the [[IDE page|IDE]] for more details.

### Matchers

`PlaySpec` mixes in ScalaTest's [`MustMatchers`](http://doc.scalatest.org/3.0.1/index.html#org.scalatest.MustMatchers), so you can write assertions using ScalaTest's matchers DSL:

```scala
import play.api.test.Helpers._

"Hello world" must endWith ("world")
```

For more information, see the documentation for [`MustMatchers`](http://doc.scalatest.org/3.0.1/index.html#org.scalatest.MustMatchers).

### Mockito

You can use mocks to isolate unit tests against external dependencies.  For example, if your class depends on an external `DataService` class, you can feed appropriate data to your class without instantiating a `DataService` object.

ScalaTest provides integration with [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) via its [`MockitoSugar`](http://doc.scalatest.org/3.0.1/index.html#org.scalatest.mock.MockitoSugar) trait.

To use Mockito, mix `MockitoSugar` into your test class and then use the Mockito library to mock dependencies:

@[scalatest-mockito-dataservice](code/ExampleMockitoSpec.scala)

@[scalatest-mockitosugar](code/ExampleMockitoSpec.scala)

Mocking is especially useful for testing the public methods of classes.  Mocking objects and private methods is possible, but considerably harder.

## Unit Testing Models

Play does not require models to use a particular database data access layer.  However, if the application uses Anorm or Slick, then frequently the Model will have a reference to database access internally.

```scala
import anorm._
import anorm.SqlParser._

case class User(id: String, name: String, email: String) {
   def roles = DB.withConnection { implicit connection =>
      ...
    }
}
```

For unit testing, this approach can make mocking out the `roles` method tricky.

A common approach is to keep the models isolated from the database and as much logic as possible, and abstract database access behind a repository layer.

@[scalatest-models](code/models/User.scala)

@[scalatest-repository](code/services/UserRepository.scala)

```scala
class AnormUserRepository extends UserRepository {
  import anorm._
  import anorm.SqlParser._

  def roles(user:User) : Set[Role] = {
    ...
  }
}
```

And then access them through services:

@[scalatest-userservice](code/services/UserService.scala)

In this way, the `isAdmin` method can be tested by mocking out the `UserRepository` reference and passing it into the service:

@[scalatest-userservicespec](code/UserServiceSpec.scala)

## Unit Testing Controllers

Since your controllers are just regular classes, you can easily unit test them using Play helpers. If your controllers depends on another classes, using [[dependency injection|ScalaDependencyInjection]] will enable you to mock these dependencies. Per instance, given the following controller:

@[scalatest-examplecontroller](code/ExampleControllerSpec.scala)

You can test it like:

@[scalatest-examplecontrollerspec](code/ExampleControllerSpec.scala)

## Unit Testing EssentialAction

Testing [`Action`](api/scala/play/api/mvc/Action.html) or [`Filter`](api/scala/play/api/mvc/Filter.html) can require testing an [`EssentialAction`](api/scala/play/api/mvc/EssentialAction.html) ([[more information about what an EssentialAction is|ScalaEssentialAction]])

For this, the test [`Helpers.call`](api/scala/play/api/test/Helpers$.html#call) can be used like that:

@[scalatest-exampleessentialactionspec](code/ExampleEssentialActionSpec.scala)
