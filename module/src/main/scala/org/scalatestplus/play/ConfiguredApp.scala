/**
 * Trait that provides a configured `Application` to the suite into which it is mixed.
 *
 * The purpose of this trait is to allow nested suites of an enclosing suite that extends [[org.scalatestplus.play.guice.GuiceOneAppPerSuite GuiceOneAppPerSuite]]
 * to make use of the `Application` provided by `GuiceOneAppPerSuite`. Trait `GuiceOneAppPerSuite` will ensure
 * the `Application` is placed in the `ConfigMap` under the key `org.scalatestplus.play.app` before
 * nested suites are invoked. This represents the "configured application" that is passed from the enclosing
 * suite to the nested suites. Trait `ConfiguredApp` extracts the `Application` from the `ConfigMap`
 * and makes it available via the `app` method it provides.
 *
 * To prevent discovery of nested suites you can annotate them with `@DoNotDiscover`. Here's an example,
 * taken from `GuiceOneAppPerSuite`'s documentation:
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * package org.scalatestplus.play.examples.oneapppersuite
 *
 * import org.scalatestplus.play._
 * import play.api.{Play, Application}
 * import play.api.inject.guice._
 *
 * class ExampleSpec extends PlaySpec with GuiceOneAppPerSuite {
 *
 *   // Override app if you need an Application with other than non-default parameters.
 *   def fakeApplication(): Application =
 *     new GuiceApplicationBuilder().configure(Map("ehcacheplugin" -> "disabled")).build()
 *
 *   "The GuiceOneAppPerSuite trait" must {
 *     "provide a FakeApplication" in {
 *       app.configuration.getString("ehcacheplugin") mustBe Some("disabled")
 *     }
 *     "make the FakeApplication available implicitly" in {
 *       def getConfig(key: String)(implicit app: Application) = app.configuration.getString(key)
 *       getConfig("ehcacheplugin") mustBe Some("disabled")
 *     }
 *     "start the FakeApplication" in {
 *       Play.maybeApplication mustBe Some(app)
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
