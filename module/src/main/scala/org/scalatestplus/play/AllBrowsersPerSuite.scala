/**
 * Trait that uses a [[http://doc.scalatest.org/3.0.1/index.html#org.scalatest.FlatSpec@sharedTests ''shared test'']] approach to enable
 * you to run the same tests on multiple browsers in a ScalaTest `Suite`, where each kind of browser is started and stopped
 * just once for the whole `Suite`.
 *
 * Note: the difference between this trait and [[org.scalatestplus.play.AllBrowsersPerTest AllBrowsersPerTest]] is that
 * this trait will allow you to write tests that rely on maintaining browser state between the tests. This is a good fit
 * for integration tests in which each test builds on actions taken by the previous tests.
 *
 * This trait overrides `Suite`'s `withFixture` lifecycle method to create a new `WebDriver`
 * instance the first time it is needed  by each test, and close it the first time it is not needed (thus allowing multiple tests
 * to share the same browser), and overrides the `tags` lifecycle method to tag the shared tests so you can
 * filter them by browser type.  This trait's self-type, [[org.scalatestplus.play.ServerProvider ServerProvider]],  will ensure
 * a `TestServer` and `Application` are available to each test. The self-type will require that you mix in either
 * [[org.scalatestplus.play.guice.GuiceOneServerPerSuite GuiceOneServerPerSuite]], [[org.scalatestplus.play.guice.GuiceOneServerPerTest GuiceOneServerPerTest]],
 * [[org.scalatestplus.play.ConfiguredServer ConfiguredServer]] before you mix in this trait. Your choice among these three
 * `ServerProvider`s will determine the extent to which a `TestServer` is shared by multiple tests.
 *
 * You'll need to place any tests that you want executed by multiple browsers in a `sharedTests` method. Because all tests in a ScalaTest `Suite`
 * must have unique names, you'll need to append the browser name (available from the `BrowserInfo` passed
 * to `sharedTests`) to each test name:
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * def sharedTests(browser: BrowserInfo) {
 *   "The blog app home page" must {
 *     "have the correct title " + browser.name in {
 *        go to (host + "index.html")
 *        pageTitle must be ("Awesome Blog")
 *     }
 * </pre>
 *
 * All tests registered via `sharedTests` will be registered for each desired `WebDriver`, as specified by the `browsers` field. When
 * running, any tests for browser drivers that are unavailable on the current platform will be canceled.
 * All tests registered under `sharedTests` will be
 * tagged automatically if they end with a browser name in square brackets. For example, if a test name ends
 * with `[Firefox]`, it will be automatically tagged with `"org.scalatest.tags.FirefoxBrowser"`. This will
 * allow you can include or exclude the shared tests by browser type using ScalaTest's regular tagging feature.
 *
 * You can use tagging to include or exclude browsers that you sometimes want to test with, but not always. If you
 * ''never'' want to test with a particular browser, you can prevent tests for it from being registered at all
 * by overriding `browsers` and excluding its `BrowserInfo` in the returned `Seq`. For example, to disable registration of
 * tests for `HtmlUnit`, you'd write:
 *
 * <pre class="stHighlight">
 * override lazy val browsers: IndexedSeq[BrowserInfo] =
 *   Vector(
 *     FirefoxInfo,
 *     SafariInfo,
 *     InternetExplorerInfo,
 *     ChromeInfo
 *   )
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note that this trait can only be mixed into traits that register tests as functions, as the shared tests technique
 * is not possible in style traits that declare tests as methods, such as `org.scalatest.Spec`. Attempting to do so
 * will become a type error once we release ScalaTest 2.2.0.
