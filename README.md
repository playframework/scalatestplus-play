scalatestplus-play
==================

ScalaTest + Play provides integration support between ScalaTest and Play Framework (http://www.playframework.com).

To use it, please add the following dependency to your project's build.sbt/Build.scala file:

  `libraryDependencies += "org.scalatestplus" %% "play" % "1.2.0" % "test"`

Version 1.2.0 depends on scalatest 2.2, to use it with scalatest 2.1.x you should use scalatestplus-play 1.1.0.
